Eve
====

An experiment to learn how to make an interpreter.<br>
Depends on ANTLR 3 (http://www.antlr.org).

Features
--------
Eve is a loosely typed, pure prototypal, pure object-oriented language. Everything is
an object, and there are no classes. Objects are generated by cloning prototypes and
existing objects. Objects have no relationship to one another; this frees the
programmer from having to deal with pointer logic.

Status
------

Very much a work in progress:

* Variable assignment works
* Variable update works
* Print statement works
* Prototype definition works
* Prototype cloning works
* Adding properties to objects works
* Basic scoping implemented

Everything else is either broken or unimplemented.
