Eve
====

An experiment to learn how to make an interpreter.<br>
Eve is a simple interpreted language that targets the JVM.

Features
--------
Eve is a dynamically strongly typed, pure prototypal, object-oriented language:

* Everything is an object, and there are no classes.
* Objects are generated by cloning prototypes and existing objects.
* Objects have no delegation relationship with one another (as in 
  JavaScript); this reduces confusion and mistakes when dealing with
  references.
* Eve runs on the Java Virtual Machine, so integration with Java code is
  possible.

article:<br>

Building
========
First, check out the code from the Git repository. The master branch always
reflects the latest stable release, while develop reflects the latest code
under development.

The primary requirement for buildin and running Eve is Java. Eve is developed
and tested on the "official" 1.6 HotSpot VM. It should work under Java 1.5, but
that environment is unsupported. It will not work under Java 1.4 or lower.

Eve uses Apache Ant for building and Apache Ivy for resolving libraries.
Make sure to install those first. On Linux, your distro may have them.
For example, to install Ant and Ivy on Ubuntu 10.10:

    sudo apt-get install ant ivy
    
If necessary, install Ant and Ivy manually. They can be found at:
<http://ant.apache.org/>
<http://ant.apache.org/ivy/>

Once having installed Ant and Ivy and putting them on your classpath, run the
build script by typing "ant" in the root of the repository. Dependencies will
be fetched and added to the classpath automatically.

The build process will produce an executable jar `eve.jar` in the `dist`
directory. Execute `java -jar dist/eve.jar` to start the interpreter.

Troubleshooting
---------------
### Building Issues ###
Before running Ant, make sure Ivy is on your classpath. If Ivy is not on the
classpath, the dependecy resolution task will fail. For example, to get Ivy on
the classpath in Ubuntu 10.10:

`export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/ivy.jar:$CLASSPATH`

### Interpreter Can't Find ANTLR Runtime ###
The executable jar has the ANTLR runtime in its classpath. Make sure a `lib/`
directory exists in the location where eve.jar is, and make sure
`antlr-runtime-3.3.jar` is in that directory. If those are present, eve should
able to be run from anywhere.

Status
======

Very much a work in progress. Completed things:

* Read and execute script files
* Debug mode
* all data types are complete.
* Variable assignment works
* Variable update works
* Print statement works
* Prototype definition works
* Prototype cloning works
* Adding properties to objects works
* Basic scoping implemented
* Cloning objects
* Very basic Java interop implemented (only internally)
* function invocation works
* Boolean data type
* if/else statements

Big things left to do:

* REPL
* import statment
* loop statements (for, while)
* Scope operator
* delete statement
* Object family support (for pushing changes to many objects)
* Ahead of Time "compilation"
* A standard library

Things to consider:

* Closures
* Multithreading
