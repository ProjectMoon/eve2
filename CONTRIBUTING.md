Contributing
============
To contribute to Eve, you need only fork the repository on GitHub and send pull
requests. Please follow the coding style that is already present in the code
when submitting changes:

* The `{` character should go on the end of method declarations, if statements,
  for loops, etc. It should not go below it (as is common in .NET). 
* If editing the AST Parser or the Lexer/Parser files, follow the grouping and
  formatting conventions in those files.
